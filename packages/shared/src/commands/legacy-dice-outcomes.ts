/**
 * Route C — the READ-TIME fallback for the legacy `dice_outcomes` table.
 *
 * Lands `docs/command/08-迁移与收敛.md` §10.3 / §10.4 / §10.5 item 2 / §12: the
 * migration's main path (route D) adds a 12-line `on.roll_resolved` block to the
 * live template cards, which is a `git`-visible change and can never reach a
 * player save (`worlds/` is untracked) or the frozen archive. This module is the
 * only thing that covers those two, and it does it without touching a single
 * file: it synthesizes the same `on` block from the table the entity already
 * carries.
 *
 * PURE and synchronous: no I/O, no clock. The caller has already parsed the
 * frontmatter and knows the entity's path; this module only decides.
 *
 * ── The sugar's ceiling, written down (08 §10.3 代价 ②) ──────────────────────
 * The legacy shorthand MUST NOT grow into a second schema, so it accepts ONLY
 * the exact shape the six worlds ship (§2.3's measured "completely uniform" 36
 * files: 4 bands, keys exactly {min,max,text,options,rewards}, 2 options, 1
 * reward, the canonical partition for the declared dice type). Anything else is
 * refused with `legacy_dice_outcomes_unexpandable` rather than silently
 * truncated — refusal is what keeps the ceiling from drifting upward.
 *
 * ── What this module does NOT synthesize, and why ────────────────────────────
 * `08 §4.1`'s sample writes the band's `options` back into the entity as
 * `choice` + `choice_actions`. Two independent blockers are on disk today, so
 * the expansion omits that write-back and says so here instead of emitting an
 * effect that cannot run:
 *   - `edit` has no `choice` argument (`WORLD_COMMAND_EFFECT_ARGS.edit.names`,
 *     `packages/shared/src/commands/effects.ts:157`) — the sample's third `edit`
 *     arg is rejected at parse time with `unknown_arg`;
 *   - the fold that would build it (`options[]` → `{choice, choice_actions}`)
 *     is `fold-args`, which no effect implements yet, and `08 §13.2`'s B-1 shows
 *     it clashes with the entities' own static `choice_actions.back` on 144/144
 *     bands anyway.
 *
 * The two effects that ARE expressible (`give` the band's reward note, `edit`
 * the grade and append the band's short text) land exactly as niko's
 * `runDeclaredRoll` did — 3 events per trigger, matching `08 §13.2` M-9.

 * The ONE command every expanded card binds to (`08 §4.2`: 1 file per world).
 *
 * Deviates from `08 §4.1`'s verbatim sample in four ways, each forced by code
 * that is already frozen on disk — a sample that does not parse executes
 * nothing, so copying it verbatim would ship the exact silent failure this
 * module exists to remove:
 *
 *  1. `frontmatter: { dice_grade: "{{ params.grade }}" }` — `{{ grade }}` is
 *     ACCEPTED at write time (`checkRef` returns early for a name that is a
 *     declared parameter, `world-command.ts:903`) but is UNREADABLE at run time:
 *     the evaluator's variable map is keyed `params.<name>` only
 *     (`execute.ts:528-533`), so `{{ grade }}` fails every trigger with
 *     `"grade" is not a readable reference here.` Reported as a code/doc split.
 *  2. `append_body` is a sibling of `frontmatter`, not a key inside it
 *     (`04 §3.5`, `effects.ts:157`).
 *  3. Three scalar refs (`reward_path` / `reward_title` / `reward_body`) instead
 *     of `rewards: "{{ trigger.entry.rewards }}"`. The whole-array form needs
 *     `list-args` over maps, and `readPath` only ever returns a scalar or a
 *     SCALAR array (`trigger.ts:485-496`) — an array of mappings resolves to
 *     `undefined`, so the bucket form fails on every band (measured).
 *  4. No `choice` fold — see the module header.
 *
 * Every band in the stock 36 files has exactly one reward, so (3) loses
 * nothing today; the expansion REFUSES a band with a second reward rather than
 * dropping it (the `08 §4.5` 缺口 3 failure shape).
 *
 * `08 §4.1`'s binding also carries `band: 0`, and this expansion does NOT.
 * `02 §15.1` — the `on` shape's owner — drops it too: the binding's INDEX
 * already selects the row (`02 §R.19`), so a second selector would be a second
 * source of truth for "which band is this". Declaring it and never reading it
 * would also make `01`'s write-time `unused_param` warning fire on every parse
 * of this command for no benefit. Reported as a `08`-vs-`02` conflict.
