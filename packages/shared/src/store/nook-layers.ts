/**
 * Nook sub-scene tree — the PARALLEL derivation to `layers.ts` (N2 00 §5.3).
 *
 * `deriveLayers` hard-codes the `world/**` filter and maps `world` → `map`;
 * nook needs neither, so instead of parameterising that load-bearing function
 * (consumed by `scanLayers` and `look-at`) this module derives a second,
 * smaller tree rooted at a character: `characters/<id>` is scene 0, and every
 * directory below it is a sub-scene (`docs/nook-scene/00 §4.1`).
 *
 * The id-agnostic primitives of `layers.ts` are REUSED, not copied: `dirOf`
 * for path semantics, `cardsOfLayer` for page membership, `childLayers` for
 * doors. Only `nookSceneOfPath` is written by hand — it must NOT inherit
 * `layerOfPath`'s silent `map` fallback (N2 00 §5.3.1).
 *
 * Directory set MUST come from `store.listDirs(nookId)`: a DIRECTORY walk
 * (empty directories included ⇒ their door card exists), NOT derived from
 * `listFiles`, a file walk where a completely empty sub-scene vanishes
 * (N2 00 §2.3, spike B vs C).
