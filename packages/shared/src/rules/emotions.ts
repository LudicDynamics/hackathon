/**
 * The six emotion differentials (docs/assets/00 §3.1 — the ONE list).
 *
 * A character's face has exactly these six moods. The character agent emits a
 * `[emo: <tag>]` tag at the head of a spoken line; the modal switches the
 * portrait to `<id>/<tag>.webp`. The enum MUST stay in lockstep with the tag
 * parser (`apps/web/src/components/overlay/dialogue-pages.ts`) and the TTS
 * stinger palette — but the *list* lives here so the server route and the web
 * client read one source instead of two hand-copied literals.
 *
 * Zero dependencies on purpose (same discipline as `rules/characters.ts` and
 * `rules/voices.ts`): the server route, the web bundle and the asset gate all
 * import this without pulling in zod, React or the world store.
