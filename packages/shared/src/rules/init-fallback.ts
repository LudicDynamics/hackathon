/**
 * W2 fallback templates — the zero-AI safety net (docs/doc-11 §5).
 *
 * When the initialiser times out, fails, or the model is unavailable, the engine
 * still drops a placeholder so the layer stops being a stub and the player sees
 * *something* (a scene that says "this has not taken shape yet" beats a scene
 * that never materialises and re-triggers forever). Pure constants: no store, no
 * AI, unit-testable.
 *
 * `material: stub` here is deliberate — it is the "not written yet" skin
 * (`MATERIAL_SKINS`, schemas/forms.ts:193-198). This is NOT in tension with the
 * "README takes the brief's default material" rule for *successful* products
 * (docs/doc-11 §3.3): that rule governs the initialiser's own output, this one
 * governs the engine's fallback.
