/**
 * GPT-Live voice gate (`pnpm check:live-voices`) — docs/live-voice/00 §9.3, §2.6.
 *
 * The bug this exists to catch: `POST /v1/live/sessions` rejects an unknown
 * voice with HTTP 403 `forbidden` (measured: `girl-next-door`, `Cherry`). So a
 * character whose README resolves to a voice OUTSIDE `LIVE_VOICES` does not
 * fall back — the whole call fails at the OpenAI boundary. Unlike the TTS
 * palette (`resolveVoice` → `null` → server default), `resolveLiveVoice` NEVER
 * returns null; the fallback is only proven by asserting the RESULT, never the
 * input.
 *
 * Three assertions (00 §9.3):
 *   L1  `resolveLiveVoice(undefined)` and unknown input return a value INSIDE
 *       `LIVE_VOICES` — the fallback itself is whitelisted.
 *   L2  every template character README's `voice:` (including the ones that
 *       declare none) resolves into `LIVE_VOICES`. A missing declaration is
 *       normal and legal; the assertion is on the RESOLVED voice, not the input.
 *   L3  every `LIVE_VOICES` entry is among the 22 names actually measured to
 *       work (00 §12 P5+P6). A whitelist may not grow an unverified name — the
 *       same discipline as docs/tts/07 §5.
 *
 * L3 is why the 22-name list is duplicated here: it is the ONE copy of the
 * measurement, and a name added to the whitelist without being re-measured
 * turns this gate red by design. This is a CONTENT gate, not a runtime one: it
 * never touches the network.
