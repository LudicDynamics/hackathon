/**
 * Engine-spawn injection probe (docs/hooks/06 §6) — the acceptance test for the
 * whole B2/B3 batch.
 *
 * `extensions/context.ts` is loaded by the engine, not by us: if the default
 * export is not a factory function the loader returns an error STRING instead of
 * throwing (`loader.ts:558-560`), and jiti can even skip the file silently
 * (`extensions/tools.ts:40-46`). A static import check cannot see that. The only
 * proof is a REAL writer spawn plus an assertion that the model actually received
 * the block — the same argument as `probe-tools-engine.mjs`.
 *
 * Observation channel: `RpcClient` runs the agent as a child process, so this
 * probe cannot read the provider's memory. `tools/inject-probe-provider.ts`
 * therefore appends each request's final wire messages to `AIRP_INJECT_PROBE_OUT`
 * (06 §6.2), which is exactly what the model saw.
 *
 * ── Granularity (docs/hooks/07 §6.1) ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The block is injected ONCE PER TRACE (one `agent_start` → `agent_end`/settled),
 * on the FIRST provider request; a tool-loop continuation returns `undefined`.
 * The old assertions (A2/A3/A4/A8) encoded the BUG — "exactly one block per
 * REQUEST" — and are reversed here as A2′/A3′/A4′/A8′.
 *
 * Delivery is in TWO stages (06 §6.6):
 *   stage 1 (wiring)   — A1′/A2′/A3′/A4′/A5/A7/A10/A11: the block appears exactly
 *                        once per trace, never accumulates across turns, is never
 *                        persisted, and the failure path stays flat. Needs no
 *                        `viewpoint` row or renderer (an empty world still yields
 *                        `[World state: nothing to report yet]`, contract §4.3).
 *   stage 2 (content)  — A6/A8′/A9: section content, degradation does not fail a
 *                        turn, sanitisation really folds newlines.
 * Both stages need 03 (event renderer) and 05 (viewpoint) to have landed.
 *
 * Argv order matters twice here:
 *   1. our probe provider is listed BEFORE the writer's own extensions, so its
 *      `context` handler observes the message array BEFORE `context.ts` appends
 *      (that "before" count is A11's judge — see the provider's header);
 *   2. the probe `--provider/--model` go LAST, because `writerLaunch` now appends
 *      `modelPreferenceArgs` (`--provider deepseek …`) and the CLI's parser is
 *      last-wins.
 *
 * Assertions are numbered A1′–A4′/A5–A7/A8′–A11 as in 06 §6.3 and printed with
 * their number.
