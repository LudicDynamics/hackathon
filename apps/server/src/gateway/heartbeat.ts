/**
 * Server-side WebSocket liveness (docs/gateway/03 §2.1/§3.2).
 *
 * A browser cannot send a protocol-level ping, so the SERVER drives it: every
 * `intervalMs` a sweep marks each client not-alive, pings it, and terminates any
 * client that was still not-alive AT THE START of the sweep — i.e. it missed the
 * previous pong. One missed pong = terminate: a NAT black-holed socket accepts
 * writes at the OS buffer, so `send` never throws and `broadcast`'s per-client
 * catch never fires (03 §3.2 step 6). The member leak is completely SILENT; only
 * active probing can reclaim it.
 *
 * Pure decision + timer, no `ws` import — the tests drive `tick()` directly.
