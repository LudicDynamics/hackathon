/**
 * reveal-gate.ts — hold the layer refetch until the dice ceremony has finished
 * (docs/command/06 §8.3).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A world command's file writes land during the HTTP request
 * (server-side, synchronous), so `file_changed` (~150ms, EventBridge's watcher
 * debounce) and `world_event` (~10-50ms) both reach the client LONG before the
 * ceremony settles (1200ms roll + 1300ms settle). Without a gate, the reward
 * cards the command just created slide onto the canvas while the dice are still
 * tumbling — behind the z-50 mask, so the player is spoiled, not informed. And
 * once the ceremony ends the refetch must still happen: the canvas is the truth,
 * and a gate that never opens is a dead end (hard gate 7).
 *
 * It is not a cache, a queue, or a store: it holds at most ONE pending closure.
 * Several arrivals inside one ceremony collapse into the last one — one refetch
 * used to mean one request per frame, each running the server's two serialising
 * write transactions (`seatUnplaced` / `reseatLayer`).
 *
 * Shape mirrors lib/dice-ceremony.ts: module state, no React, no side effects.

 * (apps/web/src/components/narrative/DiceRoller.tsx) plus 1000ms of slack. It is
