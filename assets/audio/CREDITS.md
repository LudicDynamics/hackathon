## Worldlines Canvas full-length themes

Music: MaouDamashii (Koichi Morita) — https://maou.audio/
Used under the creator's usage terms, with attribution retained from
`worldlines-canvas/app/media/CREDITS.md`. These are not CC0 tracks.
Copied byte-for-byte from `worldlines-canvas/app/media/`; no trimming,
re-encoding, or generation. World mapping follows `app/src/app.js` BGM_TRACKS.
The original Freesound theme pool below is retained, not overwritten.

| Imported file | Original file | Track | World |
|---|---|---|---|
| `themes/canvas-mistport.mp3` | `maou_bgm_piano36.mp3` | Piano 36 | mistport (world migration pending) |
| `themes/canvas-wuwu.mp3` | `maou_bgm_fantasy13.mp3` | Fantasy 13 | wuwu |
| `themes/canvas-whitechapel.mp3` | `maou_bgm_orchestra26.mp3` | Orchestra 26 | whitechapel |
| `themes/canvas-divergence.mp3` | `maou_bgm_healing17.mp3` | Healing 17 | divergence |
| `themes/canvas-firstsnow.mp3` | `maou_bgm_acoustic54.mp3` | Acoustic 54 | firstsnow |

The four migrated Canvas worlds select these full tracks through
`world.json` `audio.theme: canvas-<world>`. Playback follows the existing
theme/layer-BGM precedence and requires the first browser interaction.

## 8. Licensed, local only — `licensed/` (gitignored, **not in the repository**)

| File | Use | Title | Artist | Source | Dur | License |

> 魔王魂 terms (https://maou.audio/rule/): free for personal and commercial use;

> the files from the pages above on each machine; without them the launcher is silent.

## Notes

- **`worldlines-assets/` had no audio** — only images (375 PNG / 15 JPG). These
  files are the first audio produced for the assets workshop.
- **Runtime status**: wired — `apps/web/src/lib/audio.ts` plays these files
  (sample-first, synth as offline fallback); the synth engine is retained as the
  T3.8 degradation path. Layer selection comes from the layer README
  `ambient`/`bgm` fields; world themes from `world.json` `audio.theme`
  (docs/audio batch A1).
- **Full upstream URLs** follow the pattern
  `https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/<id/1000>/<id>_<userid>-hq.mp3`.

- **Coverage**: `bgm/` (3 moods) + `ambient/` (3 beds) + `ambient/pool/` (11 scene
  beds) + `themes/` (5 world themes) + `foley/` (9 one-shots) = 31 files.
  `gate-open` is downloaded but has **no callsite** this batch (reserved for the
  T4.3 gate transition); `page-turn` likewise awaits the book/pages layer.
  `stinger/` is defined but unproduced (6 files).
