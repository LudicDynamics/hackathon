/**
 * Agent identity for every tool shell (docs/tools/01 §3.5, 00 §3, 00 §6.1).
 *
 * pi-rp has NO "who am I" extension API — `ExtensionContext` carries
 * `sessionManager` / `ui` / `mode` / `cwd`, no role field. The ONLY identity
 * difference between the writer process and a character process is the env var
 * `AIRP_AGENT_ROLE`, injected by `airpEnv()` at spawn
 * (apps/server/src/engine/presets.ts).
 *
 * `resolveAgentActor` (packages/shared) is pure and never throws, so the whole
 * degradation table is unit-testable there; the warning is logged ONCE here.
 * Per-call logging would spam stderr a dozen times per scene-init, because
 * subagents (`spawnAgent` / `subagent`) run in this same process and inherit
 * this same env value.
