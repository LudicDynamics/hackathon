/**
 * Blank optional arguments are absent arguments (niko, 2026-09-15).
 *
 * Some models (observed: gpt-5.6 through the Vercel gateway) fill EVERY declared
 * parameter, sending `append_to: ""` or `near: ""` for the ones they do not
 * mean. The action layer rightly treats a present-but-empty value as a
 * contradiction ("chalk accepts either path or append_to, not both") and
 * refuses — and the model, seeing the refusal, retries the identical call.
 * In first-snow-zh that was seven `chalk` calls in a row, seven streamed
 * phantoms on the canvas, and nothing landed.
 *
 * The fix lives at the transport edge, once, for every tool: a declared
 * OPTIONAL property whose value is null, undefined or whitespace-only is
 * dropped before the shell sees it. Required properties are never touched —
 * an empty required string is still the model's error to hear about.
