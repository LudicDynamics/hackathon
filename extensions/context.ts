/**
 * AIRP per-turn world-state injection — the ONE top-level extension that
 * registers the `airp_world_state` custom type and the hooks behind it.
 *
 * Registered (docs/hooks/06 §2.2 as revised by 07 §2.5 table D — five, exact
 * and closed):
 *   1. `registerCustomType(WORLD_STATE_CUSTOM_TYPE, ...)` — declares the dynamic
 *      injection layer (context:'include', llmRole:'user', compaction:'exclude').
 *   2. `pi.on('agent_start', ...)` — the TURN BOUNDARY. All the heavy work
 *      (directory scan, two db reads, rendering) runs here ONCE, and the result
 *      is cached (01 §3.2 / 06 §4.1).
 *   3. `pi.on('context', ...)` — the injection seam. PURE, O(1): read the cached
 *      string and append one message. Never renders, never does I/O.
 *   4. `pi.on('turn_start', ...)` — records `event.turnIndex`: the injection
 *      gate's input (01 §3.3). `toolkit/turn.ts` has its own independent module
 *      instance; the loader's `moduleCache:false` means they share no state.
 *   5. `pi.on('turn_end', ...)` — resets the mirror to -1 so a trace is fully
 *      forgotten the moment it ends (07 §4.1 hardening 2).
 *
 * NOT registered, on purpose (06 §2.2 / §2.4):
 *   - `renderContent`: the inject block never touches the session transcript, so
 *     there is no storage round-trip that needs its identity to survive the
 *     custom → user seam. If anyone ever moves the block onto a persistent path
 *     (`sendCustomMessage` / `before_agent_start.message`), they MUST add
 *     `renderContent` in the same change — otherwise the block loses its marker.
 *   - `before_agent_start`: its `message` is persisted as a `custom_message`
 *     entry and ACCUMULATES every turn (AUDIT S1). `agent_start` covers the
 *     turn-boundary signal without that trap.
 *   - `session_compact`: every turn recomputes in full and the cache has no
 *     fingerprint — there is nothing to reset (00 §9.2 / AUDIT §3.3).
 *   - `session_start` / `leaf_changed`: not needed by the minimal version
 *     (§4.3 below).
 *   - `tool_result` (the event-table write side): outside this batch.
 *   - any `state_*` / state file / state namespace: 00 §12 item 5.
 *
 * Module state (`currentTurnIndex`, the store getters) is per-EXTENSION-FILE,
 * not per-process (00 §9 / 06 §3.1): the loader builds one
 * `createJiti(..., { moduleCache: false })` per extension file
 * (`loader.ts:503-509`, call site :556), so this file CANNOT reuse
 * `extensions/toolkit/actor.ts`'s actor cache or `deps.ts`'s store cache — those
 * are different module instances. Hence the local identity resolution below (a
 * COPY of toolkit's pattern, not a re-export) and the store getter in
 * `./toolkit/deps.js` (`peekWorldStore`), plus a self-open fallback here.
 *
 * SUBAGENTS GET NO INJECTION (06 §7): the scene-init / nook-init subagents build
 * a child session with ZERO extensions (`subagent/run.ts:79-98`) and only the
 * `tool_*` handlers are forwarded (`:109-138`). `context` / `agent_start` are
 * never forwarded. Do NOT go looking for "why B5 has no block" here — it has
 * none by design (the initialiser wants a brief, not the player's viewpoint).
 *
 * CACHE INVALIDATION IS DELIBERATELY NOT IMPLEMENTED (06 §4.3): the single-slot
 * cache is unconditionally overwritten at every turn boundary, so there is no
 * "carry the previous turn over" path and nothing to evict. A branch switch
 * (`/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/tree`) is covered by the cache key containing
 * the sessionId plus the next unconditional recompute. The only stale window is
 * `previewPrompt()` (`/prompt` preview), which never feeds a model. If a
 * long-lived process ever multiplexes several sessions, this MUST be revisited
 * by adding the two clear hooks (06 §4.3):
 *   pi.on('session_start', (event) => { writeTurnBlock(event.sessionId, null); });
 *   pi.on('leaf_changed',  (event) => { writeTurnBlock(event.sessionId, null); });
 *
 * STORAGE IS OPENED READ-WRITE, not read-only (00 §10 / 06 §5, rejecting
 * doc-22 §6):
 *   - `LocalWorldStore` unconditionally opens canvas.db / history.db read-write
 *     and runs DDL (`packages/shared/src/store/local-store.ts:63-73`).
 *   - This extension MUST write `read_cursors` (`local-store.ts:448`), so a pure
 *     read-only path is impossible.
 *   - Concurrency is carried by WAL + `busy_timeout=5000`
 *     (`packages/shared/src/db/schema.ts:5-6`, `:91-92`).
 *   Side effect to know: constructing a store in the agent process also runs the
 *   DDL, so the `viewpoint` table is created by the writer process too — not by
 *   the server alone (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is idempotent).
 *   DISCIPLINE (06 §5.3 / REVIEW A-10): never let this extension open a SECOND
 *   store when one already exists. `initCanvasDatabase` carries shape-probing
 *   REBUILDS (`DROP TABLE` then `CREATE` for presence / links, schema.ts:29-58 /
 *   :117-136), and WAL + busy_timeout do NOT stop DDL. Max 2 connections per
 *   process, and prefer reusing B1's store via `peekWorldStore()`.
